# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Homelab

## Overview
Homelab is an open-source project designed to simplify the setup, management, and orchestration of self-hosted services using Docker and Kubernetes. The project aims to provide a modular, extensible, and community-driven platform for running a wide variety of applications and infrastructure components at home or in small-scale environments.

## Goals
- Enable easy deployment and management of Docker and Kubernetes services.
- Provide templates, scripts, and best practices for self-hosted projects.
- Foster a collaborative community for sharing configurations and improvements.
- Ensure security, maintainability, and scalability for home and small business use.

## Features
- Pre-configured Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests for popular self-hosted services (e.g., media servers, monitoring, networking tools).
- Automated setup scripts for common infrastructure (e.g., reverse proxies, SSL, storage).
- Documentation and guides for setup, troubleshooting, and customization.
- Contribution guidelines and community support channels.

## Target Audience
- Home lab enthusiasts
- Developers and tinkerers
- Small business IT admins
- Open source contributors

## Non-Goals
- Not intended for large-scale enterprise production environments.
- Not a replacement for managed cloud services.

## Success Metrics
- Number of contributors and community engagement.
- Breadth and reliability of supported services.
- User feedback and adoption rate.

## Roadmap
1. Initial setup scripts and documentation
2. Docker Compose templates for core services
3. Kubernetes manifests for advanced orchestration
4. Community-contributed service templates
5. CI/CD integration and automated testing
